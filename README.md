# General Neuroscience Data Analysis Assessments
## Overveiw
This repository contains script and the final reports from data analysis assessments from the honours years of the Neuroscience course at Edinburgh University. We were given a number of data sets for each assessment and had to apply our knowladge of descriptive and inferral statistics to decide which test was appropraite by assessing the aim and objective of the study, type and distribution of the data provided, and nature of the observations (i.e. whether the data was paired/unpaired), as well as produce figures to support the analysis using R. A range of statistical tests were used for these assessments including a 1-factor and 2-factor General Linear Model, student t-test, Shapiro-Wilk test, The Wilcoxon test, Fishers Exact test, correlation tests and priori power tests demonstrating a range of skills in both parametric and non-paramatric testing.
